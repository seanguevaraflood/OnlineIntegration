# **Summary** {#summary}

Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop is operated by a very nice older couple and related stakeholders. Through this collaboration, the business has done exquisite work for over 40 years. I fear, however, that they were missing out on a lot of potential customers because they were only available via phone and did not have a website. To contact them, you either had to go to the shop in person or call. Not only was this inconvenient for both parties, but it also was inefficient. The lack of a centralized hub that is easily accessible to past, present, and future customers was a limiting factor in regard to the growth potential of this stellar business. We thought about utilizing physical advertising but determined the cost would be far too high for the return of value and would not satisfy the business needs of Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop. This is partly due to the semi-niche nature of Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop’s business model. For this reason, we needed to find a way to solve these issues at a cost-effective price point.   
A solution that solved the inefficiency of Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop’s business operations while bringing more awareness to its amazing services at a good price point was to establish a strong online presence. This online presence resulted in more business. This online presence included  
 a website and various other internet channels that are relevant to the businesses’ outreach. We integrated the work that Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop conducts daily in its online presence as a way to advertise its services to a greater audience. The website was populated with relevant information and a contact form that made it easily accessible for customers to get the information they needed to book services and file other inquiries. Along with this, the website and necessary contact pages, we also integrated Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop into Google’s Business Index. This allowed the business to be easily accessible and the information regarding the hours, location, and website link to be prominently visible. This increased the chance of a customer in the area stumbling across Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop. We also optimized the metadata of all digital aspects of the business. This resulted in the highest probability of customers finding Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop.  
	To make this online integration a success, we started with a thorough but seamless online integration plan. We used the Waterfall Model as a framework to guide the implementation for a holistic and well-rounded approach. The Waterfall Model has six phases: requirements, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. We followed each phase closely to ensure our implementation best fulfilled Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop’s business needs and exceeded the expectations of all the stakeholders in this operation.   
In the requirements phase, we met with the owners of Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop to get an understanding of their goals and needs regarding the implementation of this project. We also outlined our vision and plan for the implementation of the online infrastructure. Once our meeting was concluded, we drafted a set of guidelines and a framework that reflected how we conducted the implementation.  
Following the requirements phase, is the design phase. In this stage, we had our Chief Technology Officer create a loose visual diagram to visualize the website’s implementation. As a secondary step, they also strategized positioning and techniques for the online implementation. This ensured we best maximize the value gained from this implementation and digital presence. This also ensured the implementation was as smooth as possible.   
Next, we entered the development phase. In this phase, we focused on the actual development of the transition. We leveraged our Chief Technology Officer’s technical skills to develop the transitional strategy for this implementation. Our aim was to best suit the needs of the business at the best cost. We achieved that. Our development team is well-experienced in online implementations so we could assure Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop that we would produce a high-level strategy for the transition. We focused on what aspects had to be migrated online during the implementation and maximized value for Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop which made the move as seamless as possible.  
The fourth stage in the Waterfall Model is the testing phase. In this phase, we conducted tests simulating the implementation, ruling out any bugs and errors that could get in the way of the deployment stage. We also tested for internal server errors, HTTP errors, timeouts, general glitches, or any other common web errors that would result in difficulties with the implementation.  
The second to last phase of the Waterfall Development Model is the deployment phase. In this phase, the implementation was initiated. It was an exciting time for all parties involved. With this initiated, we were then able to complete the full integration.  
The final stage is the maintenance phase. Here we made sure the integration had gone smoothly and remediated any issues that came up during or after the integration so we could be assured it ran smoothly. This concluded our implementation of an online integration for Vintage Audio/Repair Shop.   
The implementation was a success, and we were able to successfully transition Vintage Audio Repair Shop’s business into the digital world. This implementation brought a lot of value to the business, drawing in many more customers, solving information inquiries automatically, and providing a place where customers could congregate. The combination of a functional website, Google Business Index, and SEO optimization elevated the brand’s exposure, successfully disseminated important business information, and streamlined its business operations. This integration resulted in more service requests, awareness, and overall value delivered to Vintage Audio/Repair Shop.

## **Review Of Work 1** {#review-of-work-1}

	We were conscious that launching a website successfully and optimally is not an easy task. For this reason, we conducted external research so we could be sure we were covering all bases in support of this launch. We wanted to learn from those who are at the top of the web popularity spectrum so we could incorporate some of their strategies and foundational principles. To improve our understanding, we reviewed the Forbes article titled, “First 10 Things You Should Do When Launching a Website”. This article provided very helpful and actionable insights such as, “Create at least 3-5 pieces of high-quality content”, “Learn the basics of SEO”, and “Start networking with influencers in your field” (Forbes, 2016). This article outlines key principles to ensure a successful website is established. This article also identifies the key aspects of an interactive and successful website. Absorbing and applying the advice contained in this write-up helped us integrate engaging content in the right places to visually appeal to our customers so they were more likely to use Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop’s services. The information from this article was a perfect fit for our online integration of Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop. Following these guidelines throughout the implementation process kept us from missing important details and prevented easy-to-miss pitfalls. 

## **Review Of Work 2** {#review-of-work-2}

	A big factor in the success of an online website is load speed. For Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop to best serve its customer base, we needed to make sure there were no load issues when customers were interfacing with its web front.  To make sure we could ensure proper load time speed, we consulted the write-up, “8 Page Speed Tips: How To Speed Up Web Page Loading Time” provided by Score.org. For context, Score.org is a massive organization that helps cultivate growth for small businesses. This article worked to cement the validity of our speed-optimization techniques. Key techniques that were also referenced in this article were ones we used to achieve optimized load speed. These included “Remove Unnecessary Plugins”, “Evaluate Bandwidth and Storage”, and “Optimize Your Images Prior To Upload” (Socre.org, 2024). A direct example of this was, to optimize load speed on this website, we made sure to resize images before we uploaded them. This minimized the amount of load the website had to process. We iterated and took an even more minimalistic approach as a result of reading this article. We cut down on our storage use and disabled all unnecessary plugins. As a result, the website load speed increased, providing a better experience to the user.

## **Review Of Work 3** {#review-of-work-3}

	Now that we had the website content, accessibility, design, load speed, and formatting square-ed away, we needed to focus on the visibility of the website. A key component that needed to be considered was SEO. SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. Nailing Search Engine Optimization, in layman’s terms, makes your website more easily accessible for those who are searching for it, or those who are searching for relevant topics relating to the website. We decided to get information straight from the source. We consulted a technical write-up on Google’s Developer Document Repository. The specific document we focused on was titled, “Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Starter Guide”. This document provided an extensive explanation and guide to Search Engine Optimization. Although we reviewed this document thoroughly, three main points stood out to us. These three key overarching topics were, “Use descriptive URLs”, “Group topically similar pages in directories”, and “Optimize your videos” (Google, 2024). From the knowledge we gained by dissecting this article we were able to make sure every URL and connected URL was descriptive and linked. This helps the internet properly categorize the content furthering SEO optimization. We then made sure to group these pages in each directory. Finally, we optimized videos by adding text descriptions around them. These steps greatly increased our SEO strength and the probability of new customers organically stumbling across the business. 

# **Changes To Project Environment** {#changes-to-project-environment}

## **Original Environment** {#original-environment}

Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop is a great business and has been for many years. Their attention to detail and thorough work ethic have made them a go-to stop for anyone with hard-to-service equipment. They were certainly near the top of the totem pole in this niche but were missing out on a very valuable opportunity. For this reason, we saw an online integration as necessary to extend Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop’s reach into the digital domain.  
This online integration has allowed Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop to extend its reach and find more clients. A website enables potential customers, in need of their service, to have an easy and centralized way to contact them. The website being well-suited to both native desktop and mobile platforms is a holistic approach that allows customers to reach Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop’s website from their homes or on the go. In its current state, Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop has a strong business model. However, in combination with an online presence, its brand strength and visibility would be amplified in comparison to its current environment. Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop’s high-quality repairs will be shared more easily between customers and inquiries will be more easily met. In their current state, to find out if you can get your equipment serviced, you would have to walk in, lugging in your vintage equipment (which can be difficult), and asking if it can be serviced. This environment can lead to frustration for both the client and the business. Altering their current state with a contact page and digital accessibility, you would easily be able to submit a service request, and the team at Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop can quickly and more efficiently answer the customer’s inquiry. Furthermore, this foray into the digital landscape will also result in more returning customers, as inquiring about servicing will be readily and easily available.  
Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop’s organizational culture is built on quality work for important tasks. This organizational culture has resulted in a healthy group of loyal customers who entrust their delicate and precious vintage equipment to the expert technicians who work at Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop. For this reason, the online integration will only work to cement that culture publicly, by providing testimonials and examples of the great work Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop has done in the past. Pictures and videos will easily convey that culture to past, present, and future customers who require Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop’s services.   
The environment of Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop is complex but stable. Requiring highly skilled technicians who can service difficult and temperamental vintage equipment, finding these technicians is a challenge. While this aspect of the business is certainly difficult, Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop is so specialized that returning customers are common. Since Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop is servicing older equipment, as long as people continue enjoying the unique nature of vintage equipment, Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop will continue to have a strong customer base. For this reason, an online presence brings a lot of awareness to these potential future repeat customers. In their current business environment, the service Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop provides is stellar, so scaling it by leveraging online resources such as a website would only work to grow the customer base and revenue.   
Vintage Audio Video Repair Shop’s strategy is very solid. Have a highly specialized service and execute it at a high level. Servicing vintage models from brands such as ARRI, AMS, and Solid State Logic is a very difficult task. Finding a quality and trusted technician is an even more difficult endeavor, with this being said, Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop has over 40 years of quality work. Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop fills a good amount of space in the vintage audio and video repair market. With an online presence, Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop dominates the space. As the quality-of-service Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop provides is very high, amplifying the customer base and brand awareness brings a lot of value to the company and service.   
In this modern digital landscape, for a business not to have an online presence, is leaving a lot of value on the table. Although the implementation is simple, it will certainly bring a lot of value. Allowing customers to send service requests online through a contact page is a powerful utility. The website also acts as a hub for those who interface with Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop. This project increases brand awareness and as a result, service requests, meaning revenue generated for Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop.

## **Current Environment** {#current-environment}

The implementation of this online presence has only worked to amplify all the things Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop does well. To start, the website has allowed customers to access services on the go. It has greatly reduced the amount of time the team at Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop has to utilize the phone. A lot of service requests now come directly from the integrated contact page. This has increased the amount of time the team can be productive during work hours. This increase in revenue has allowed them to employ more technicians. This increase in demand, along with their increase in productivity has resulted in a substantial increase in revenue.   
As SEO was optimized, Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop began to interact with customers who said they discovered the business from their website. This is huge as prior discovery of their services was only through word-of-mouth. In its current environment, Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop dominates the vintage audio and video repair market. Customers now have shared the website amongst other vintage equipment enthusiasts. This organic spread of the brand’s quality has allowed them to always be booked. As time goes on this company could scale their operation further. To summarize, in its current environment, the sky's the limit\!

# **Methodology** {#methodology}

The Online Integration for Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop followed the ADDIE methodology. The phases of the ADDIE methodology are analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation. The ADDIE methodology is well suited to an online integration as it is streamlined and holistic in nature.   
To begin we started at the analysis phase, where we met with the stakeholders at Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop and established a timeline, expected functionality, and cost of the online integration. This meeting was very thorough so that these crucial foundations were accurately established.   
The next phase of the ADDIE methodology is the design phase. In this phase, we focused on the visual aspects of Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop’s online presence. We created wireframes to visualize our ideas about layout and web flow. We also, in thorough detail, specified what information is presented and where. We then took into account and designed how the website would look on mobile devices, as mobile functionality is very relevant in this modern digital landscape. We worked congruently with Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop’s stakeholders to solidify a vision that both parties were happy with. After this stage was complete, we moved on to the next phase of the ADDIE methodology.  
The third phase of the ADDIE methodology is the development phase. In this phase, we developed the online infrastructure. We crafted the website to the specifications identified in the previous steps. We engineered the website to follow the wireframes that were previously approved but added the necessary live features and functionality. We then tested this prototype on multiple browsers, devices, and platforms to ensure a seamless experience for all users of the website. With close review, we developed a website that ruled out anything that prevented the customer from having a seamless experience. This quality assurance test was conducted from multiple browsers, device mediums, and internet qualities to ensure a well-rounded experience across the board.  If we found any issues or unintended results, we remediated them immediately. Once development was completed, we presented the prototype to Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop’s stakeholders. It was approved, and we moved on to the fourth phase of integration.  
The fourth phase of the ADDIE methodology is the implementation phase. In this stage, we deployed the website in a live environment. We moved the prototype to the public server and linked it to Google’s Business Index. This allowed people to find the business recommended in Google searches. We also drove more traffic to the website with customers through in-person conversions. Through these in-person conversions, a healthy discourse was developed among customers that helped bring awareness to the website. We also established the necessary channels digitally so that the website could appear on Google’s Business Index and other related search engines. The website then started to be accessed by the public and began aiding in achieving the business goals of Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop.   
The fifth and final stage of the ADDIE methodology is the evaluation phase. In this phase, we continued using methods that optimized the website’s performance and speed. We conducted speed tests to ensure that the website was performing up to a reasonable standard.  We also shared our findings and listened to the thoughts of the stakeholders at Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop to correct anything necessary. In this final phase, we also conducted reviews of the project for roughly 4 months. Through these reviews, we found we did not have to scale up the website. However, in the future, if growth remains at this rate, an upgrade may be necessary. In addition, we took feedback from the owners of Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop, and feedback from customers into account for small changes or tweaks to improve how the website works in the eyes of the stakeholders and customers. The evaluation stage allowed us to perfect the delivery of this online integration.  
Using the ADDIE methodology, we made sure we had a joint understanding of the process and drove a positive outcome for both parties. This project ended up being less iterative than most, as the ideas about functionality and design were established collaboratively beforehand, but the evaluation stage helped us perfect the delivery of this online integration.

# **Project Goals, Objectives, and Deliverables** {#project-goals,-objectives,-and-deliverables}

## **Project Goals, Objectives, and Deliverables Descriptions** {#project-goals,-objectives,-and-deliverables-descriptions}

* **Goal 1**: We developed an online presence for Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop to help diversify the channels in which their excellent service could be found. This resulted in more exposure and more customers. The goal was to satisfy this lack of exposure in the digital realm with a strong online presence. Our online presence drew in new customers and allowed the business to serve them more efficiently by automating service requests. Our online presence helped existing customers spread the word about the quality work Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop conducts daily.  
  1. **Objective 1.a**: Implemented a hub that users can access easily from many different platforms and devices. The objective we executed was to have the hub meet the needs of the company and stakeholders to best serve Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop.  
  2. **Objective 2.a**: We made sure the information on this hub was easily available and easy to use. The design had to best serve the customer base. As a result, we ensured the best experience for all customers regardless of whether it was their first time utilizing Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop’s services, or someone who has utilized Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop’s quality service for 40 years\!  
     * **Deliverable 1.a:** We satisfied these needs by taking a thorough position in the development of a website. We worked with those involved in the process to make sure we got a product everyone was satisfied with. We also made sure the website was very mobile-compatible as many people access websites with mobile devices in the modern digital era.  
     * **Deliverable 1.b:** We also made sure all the information about Vintage Audio Video Repair Shop is readily available on said website. It needed to be clear and concise, so we went through iterations of integration to get to a place where the information and placement were best for the services and business goals of Vintage Audio Video Repair Shop. Having the contact page be prominent and easily accessible was a must. We made the design the most practically and functionally effective to satisfy the needs of past, present, and future customers of Vintage Audio Video Repair Shop.

* **Goal 2:** We made sure Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop appeared in popular search channels. We also made sure that the result provided useful functionality to the customer. This was so customers looking for the business could easily find it. We ensured the business appeared for customers in the local area.  
  1.  **Objective 2.a:** We made getting information about Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop as easy as possible. We now have customers able to commonly inquire about information in channels that are used often. We made this as easy as possible to have the lowest probability of any sort of confusion within the present and future customer base. In making sure the information is reliable and accessible to all, Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop now does not have to worry about the stress of disseminating information to a big customer base. Through savvy use of common web channels, we satisfied this essential need of any business that aspires to thrive in the modern digital era.  
  2. **Objective 2.b:** We also optimized the probability a customer finds Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop and utilizes their services. To achieve this, we optimized its digital presence, so that all necessary backend configurations best suited the discovery of the website.  
     * **Deliverable 2.a:** We also ensured Vintage Audio Video Repair Shop appeared on Google’s Business Index. This has made the website accessible to anyone searching on Google. We populated the Google Business entry with all the necessary information, so hours, website, and location are now listed for easy consumption. Another key reason was that now when potential new customers are looking for vintage audio or video repair on Google, Vintage Audio Video Repair Shop is listed. This has provided another way for potential customers to find the website, thus bringing more traffic, service requests, and value. Making this information easily accessible has saved the company time as Google’s Business entry and website answer common questions that customers previously would call Vintage Audio Video Repair Shop regularly to ask. This has granted those who work at Vintage Audio Video Repair Shop, more time to focus on other business endeavors that bring the company value. Another key benefit regarding adding Vintage Audio Video Repair Shop to the Google Business Index is, that because the business is getting more popular, people are visiting the website and providing reviews. This has caused the website to appear more often in search results. A simplified explanation of what this means is the website is starting to be presented to those that Google or other search engines think would be interested in vintage audio or video repair. This synergistic relationship then works as a feedback loop to amplify and fuel each method of discovery. As time progresses, the search result has continued to gain strength. This has provided customers with another way to stumble across the business organically. Before, the business relied on word-of-mouth for the dissemination of its services. This was somewhat effective, but optimizing its digital presence has taken the business to another level of efficiency and operational excellence.  
     * **Deliverable 2.b:** We also made sure that the metadata of the Google Business entry and website were correct and optimized to the greatest strength for SEO growth. The right metadata was essential for our successful online presence. With the right tags and correct information 

       Vintage Audio Video Repair Shop now has the best chance of appearing first in front of future customers.

       

The web integration has brought about business value, made business operations more efficient, increased visibility, and elevated Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop’s brand awareness. On this website, we also delivered a contact page, which has saved Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop precious operation time.  
Delivering an accurate filling in Google’s Business Index was essential. This addition has provided concise information regarding the business. This in tandem with the correct metadata ensured that the website and related channels were optimally implemented. This ensured the most value from the website and these online endeavors in general. It also best established Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop’s brand image and presence in the digital domain.  
The mixture of integrated project goals, objectives, and deliverables provided a well-rounded approach to achieving Vintage Audio Video Repair Shop’s business goals. These deliverables were clearly defined, and the details were established in meetings with Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop’s stakeholders. These deliverables were hard commitments, but due to the nature of collaboration and our dedication to improvement, these deliverables were constantly iterated throughout the development process. In this collaborative process of refining the specifications, there was a loop of communication and feedback. Using this information, the deliverables were even more granularly tailored to the needs as the implementation progressed.   
To provide a summary of our goals, objectives, and executable deliverables, we have provided a table below. This table outlines the goals with their corresponding objectives and deliverables. For example, providing an outstanding website that had all the functionality and requested features, as agreed upon in our meetings, is found on the right side of the table under deliverables. The first table we have provided contains these said project goals, objectives, and deliverables which outlines the interconnectedness of each of the goals, with related objectives, and deliverables. Each goal has a matching objective and each objective has a related deliverable. This makes each service provided, located in the right-most column, more easily and transparently digestible. We have also specified whether each delivery was met or not to provide a summary of our performance.   
Below that table is a second one, providing all the necessary information in relation to the project dates, project timelines, and milestones. This table summarizes, in a visual form, our approach to this project. Each milestone has a start and end date for a general visible summary of the project, timewise. We also included a comparison in the table between the planned time and the project’s actual development time. This is to provide further insight into the development process. Please feel free to reference the table below.

## 

## **Goals, Objectives, and Deliverables Table** {#goals,-objectives,-and-deliverables-table}

|  | Goal | Supporting Objectives | Deliverables In Relation To The Project Objectives | Met/Not Met |
| :---- | :---- | ----- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | Develop an online presence for Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop, to help diversify the channels in which their excellent service can be found. | Implemented a hub users can access easily from many different platforms and devices. | Develop a high-quality website for Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop where users can congregate. | **Met**	 |
|  |  | Made sure all the information is easily available, and the hub is very easy to use with necessary functionality to aid in business value. | Ensured the website is functional for all platforms and included a contact page listed for ease of use.  | **Met** |
| 2 | Ensure Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop had other ways to be discovered effectively by potential customers.  | Made Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop easily accessible though popular channels. | Made sure Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop appears in Google’s Business Index with accurate information. | **Met** |
|  |  | Optimized the probability a customer finds Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop and utilizes their services. | Also Ensured the metadata of the Google Business entry and website are correct and optimized for the greatest SEO growth potential. | **Met** |

# **Project Timeline with Milestones** {#project-timeline-with-milestones}

| Milestone | Planned Duration | Actual Duration | Actual Start Date  | Actual End Date |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Analysis Phase | 30 Days | 30 Days | 2023-03-01 | 2023-03-30 |
| Design Phase | 30 Days | 30 Days | 2023-03-31 | 2023-04-30 |
| Development Phase | 60 Days | 65 Days | 2023-05-01 | 2023-07-05 |
| Implementation Phase | 90 Days | 90 Days | 2023-07-06 | 2023-10-04 |
| Evaluation Phase  | 120 Days | 120 Days | 2023-10-5 | 2024-02-02 |

	Taking into account all the circumstances, our team did very well in our project timeline delivery. We are very experienced in online integration delivery, so we remained well-oriented with the initial timeline. That being said, there was a 5-day discrepancy between the planned duration and the actual duration in the development phase. With the specified design structure that we collaborated with Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop to develop, we ended up having trouble fully optimizing the mobile device platform of the website. The presentation of the website looked great on desktop and multiple browsers. The issue was some of the web elements we styled with CSS were not appearing correctly on the horizontal platform. To remedy this, we edited the source code. Specifically by adding a Max-Width parameter. This parameter changes the size of the element depending on the device it is presented on. This remedied the issue. Applying this to all necessary elements was time-consuming, but we got the job done.  
	Another factor that brought about that 5-day discrepancy in our timeline was an unexpected issue with embedding the videos we wanted to. We noticed that the number of videos on the previously approved website made the presentation cluttered, no matter how we changed the element’s parameter. This is because, when the website was in horizontal orientation, like on mobile devices, it could only fit so many videos on screen at one time. Although the initial design was strong, we had to make modifications in the development phase. This required a new proposal with the stakeholders at Vintage Audio Video Repair Shop. The time it took to get this iteration approved and developed was the final factor that contributed to the 5-day discrepancy. 

# **Unanticipated Scope Creep** {#unanticipated-scope-creep}

	Along with some of the factors that contributed to the 5-day extension of the development phase, we also had some scope creep and unanticipated requirements. These came about in the form of additional features requested by Vintage Audio/Video Repair during our design phase. Vintage Audio/Video Repair specified they wanted to add a “Previous Works” section. Along with this section, they also specified they wanted to have two distinct sections between audio and video. While this, in practice, was achievable, the extensive work that Vintage Audio/Video Repair has done in its 40-year history would have required the development of many sections and increased our development time significantly. This could have also potentially slowed down the speed of our website. We worked with the stakeholders at Vintage Audio/Video Repair to find a healthy medium of functionality and information. Instead, we opted to create a quick image/text index of all the brands that Vintage Audio/Video Repair services. This provided a simple way for customers to find the information we needed. We also added a link below the brand images stating, “If you do not see your brand listed here, feel free to use our contact page to inquire whether we service your brand.” This provided fruitful as instead of customers calling up for brand inquiries; they used the contact form because it was more readily accessible.  
	Another unanticipated requirement was developing an “Our Team” page. The “Our Team” page was to consist of pictures of the technicians and staff at Vintage Audio/Video Repair shop and a short description to accompany the pictures.  When this was brought up, we agreed it would be a great idea. What we did not realize at the time was Vintage Audio/Video Repair did not have high enough quality, standardized photos. To remedy this, we assigned our visual department to fulfill this requirement. It was a one-day shoot at our facility's headquarters. We then integrated these photos into the specified page. We also made sure to optimize the size before uploading the images to the website to optimize load time. We also increased the text size on the website, consulting feedback from some of our older users.

# **Conclusion** {#conclusion}

Defining success was very important for a large and in-depth process such as online integration for a successful in-person business. It was important that we had both quantitative and qualitative data points so we could best, objectively, and subjectively measure success. For this reason, we outlined measurable metrics. These specific metrics were a reflection of the individuals interfacing with Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop. These have been broken down in the paragraphs below along with the methods of collection. Data and feedback are essential for growth and were utilized as the project was put into a live environment.   
To define the success of our integration we set very clear bounds. We were expecting a 30% increase in service requests within the first 120 days of our online integration. We expected this number to only increase from the baseline measurement of the previous 120 days, which was before the online integration. We also tracked the customer’s interactions with the website. We quantified how many visitors used the website and booked through the website. This helped us estimate the time saved by the utility of our self-serve website contact page.  
To capture the quantitative data, we provided integrated optional surveys attached to completed service requests. This allowed customers to submit feedback about their experience with the service and website. We could then also utilize direct feedback from the stakeholders at Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop. This was a good way to measure both the businesses’ perspective and the customers’ perspective of the integration.  
To capture the quantitative data, we compared the amount of service requests received from the baseline to the first 120 days of the implementation. We also tracked the website traffic to see the number of visitors the website receives. This metric was not comparable to any other but ended up being a good way to quantify the interaction with the implantation and provided a dataset that reflected the gained exposure as a result of this online integration.  
Our definition of success had both a quantitative and qualitative metric. Success in the quantitative realm was if the integration reflected a 30% increase in service requests within the first 120 days of the online integration in comparison to the previous 120 days from the baseline. Another good metric was to see if more than 100 people entered Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop’s website. This also was a good metric to review new interactions in a general sense.  
On the qualitative front, we amassed the general sentiment from the business and consumer base. If the sentiment was more so positive than negative, we classified that as a qualitative success. We captured the specific feedback received and used it to further the design of the online implementation.   
Measuring both quantitative and qualitative metrics and combining the insights from the two gave us the full picture of the effectiveness of the online integration for Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop. This data reinforced our understanding of the success of the project and gave us further insights regarding how to integrate more in the future. Once the data was amassed and reviewed, we developed our final conclusion as to the success of the online integration for Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop.   
To begin this analysis, we will start with the quantitative data first. We observed a 45% increase in service requests in comparison to the baseline results. We classify this as a huge success far exceeding our expectations. This meant a lot more revenue generated for Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop as they could occupy all their time completing this increase in service requests. We also documented over 200 visitors entered Vintage Audio/Video Repair’s website. This is huge and was a factor in the increase in service requests. With a 45% increase in service requests and over 200 visitors entering the website, we can classify this as a quantifiable success for Vintage Audio/Video Repair Shop.  
On the qualitative front, we compiled the surveys and general sentiment of customers that accessed the website. The sentiment was overwhelmingly positive.
